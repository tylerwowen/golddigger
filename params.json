{"name":"GOLD Digger","tagline":"Gaucho On-line Data UNOFFICIAL Client App","body":"### Thank you for using `GOLDDigger`!\r\n\r\n[![app store](https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/images/badges/en-us/badge_appstore-lrg.svg)](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/golddigger-ucsb-unofficial/id1079735447?mt=8)\r\n\r\n### About `GOLDDigger`\r\n`GOLDDigger` makes UCSB students interact with GOLD (Gaucho On-line Data) easier.\r\n\r\nIt provides the following features:\r\n* Shows a list of current enrolled classes and their details\r\n* Exports class schedule to Calendar\r\n* Sends pass time notification (local)\r\n\r\n### Q&As\r\n#### Why did you make `GOLDDigger`?\r\nI wish this could help people to get their class schedule easier. At the beginning of every quarter, I, and many other students, have to log in to GOLD and use its mobile-unfriendly page to find my class time and location. Later, I need to manually create calendars events for my classes.\r\n\r\nSimilar situation happens to pass time as well. I once forgot my pass time and didn't realize until people around me started to talking about registration classes. That was about a week after my pass 1. I hope the pass time notification can help you not forget your pass time.\r\n\r\n#### Is it safe to use `GOLDDigger`?\r\nYes. Your Net ID and password is only stored in your phone.\r\n\r\n#### What about the pass time notification? How do you know when to send notifications if you don't know my pass time?\r\niOS supports both local notifications and remote nitifacations. `GOLDDigger` uses the local version, so, again, your pass time is stored in your phone.\r\n\r\n### The color scheme looks awful.\r\nYes, I did it on purpose. Let me know if you want to and know how to improve it. See below for contact information.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@tylerwowen\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n[Email](mailto:ouyang@cs.ucsb.edu) me.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
